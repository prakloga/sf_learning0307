//üìì  Time Zones Around the World
/*
Kishore runs the command SELECT current_timestamp(); in a worksheet (in October) and sees -0600 as part of the results.

-0600 is the same thing as UTC-6.

This means Kishore's Snowflake session is currently using the Denver time zone. 

What time zone is your Snowflake Trial Account using?  Run the current_timestamp() command to find out. Our guess is that you'll see either UTC-7 (-0700) or UTC-8 (-0800) depending on the time of year it is (daylight savings time).

We can guess this because all Snowflake Trial Account use "America/Los_Angeles" as the default. This may be because Snowflake was founded in San Mateo, California, USA.

/*üìì How Can We Find Out What the Z Means in Agnie's Data? 
The team needs to find out how the datetime data is being captured.  There are common methods for learning about source data. 

Ask someone who knows, or might know. 
Look at some documentation, somewhere.
Create your own test records and compare what you know to what flows through. 
Most teams will use a combination of all three of the methods. Sometimes a team will use one method to start, and another to confirm.

//üñºÔ∏è Agnie Downloads an Updated Log File!
/*
After confirming with Tsai and Kishore on Discord, Agnie adds IP_ADDRESS to the list of fields in the feed and removes AGENT. Then, she outputs a new file.

Kishore already gave her read/write access to his S3 bucket (uni-kishore), so she creates a folder named "updated_feed" and loads the new file into it. 

Now it's time for Kishore (and YOU!) to check for that new file, view the records pre-load ($1!), load them, and view them again using the LOGS view. 
*/

/*
üéØ CHALLENGE: Update Your Process to Accommodate the New File
Find the new file Agnie downloaded from the game platform by listing files in the stage you already set up. Agnie put it in a different folder. It's not in the "kickoff" folder. 
Assess whether the GAME_LOGS table will need to be modified to accommodate the added IP_ADDRESS field. 
If GAME_LOGS table needs to be changed, change it. 
Load the file into the GAME_LOGS table. 

TIPS
Do not remove the old rows (or if you do remove them by accident, re-load them). 
Remember that our previous load was done with a COPY INTO pointed at the folder "kickoff." This new file is in a different folder. 
Look at the data in the GAME_LOGS table after you load it. Understand how the second set of rows differs from the first set that was loaded.

Add a WHERE clause that will remove the first set of records from the view results. Do NOT remove the rows from the table.

If you remove the old rows by accident, re-load them. 
The order of the columns doesn't matter.
