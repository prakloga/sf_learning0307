His coworkers suggest the following improvements:
He could add some file metadata columns to the load so that he will have a record of what files he loaded and when. 
He could move the logic from the PL_LOGs view into the same select. 
If he does change the select logic, he will then need a new target table to accommodate the output of the new select. 
When he has a new select that matches the new target table, he can put it into a new COPY INTO statement. 
After he has a new COPY INTO, he could put it into an Event-Driven Pipeline (instead of a task-based Time-Driven Pipeline)

//ðŸŽ¯ Create a New Target Table to Match the Select  (Using CTAS, if you want to)
/*
You're going to create a new logs table in the RAW schema and call it ED_PIPELINE_LOGS. You could write this table definition any way you want. Use a template, write it manually, or use a CTAS. 
To create the table using CTAS, simply type CREATE TABLE <table name> AS on the line above your SELECT statement, and run it.
Using CTAS creates the table and loads it in one step. If you create the table another way, you will need to write an INSERT statement using the SELECT and run that, too.
After creating the new table and loading it, go look at your table and the rows in it to see what you think of it.
