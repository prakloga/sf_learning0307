‚ùï Setting Up Your Trial Account
Check to see if you have a warehouse named COMPUTE_WH that is sized XS and will auto-suspend. If you don't have one, create it. 
Check to see if you have a database named UTIL_DB and if you don't have one, consider creating one that can serve as the home to your DORA GRADER function. 
Make sure the SYSADMIN role owns the COMPUTE_WH, the UTIL_DB database, and the PUBLIC schema of the UTIL_DB database.

/*üéØ Setting Some Defaults
You may want to set some DEFAULT values for your USER. 

These make using Snowflake more convenient by setting your worksheet context for you automatically.

Kishore's USERNAME in his Snowflake Account is KISHOREK (it's what he uses to login to Snowflake).

He runs the following commands:
*/
alter user PLOGANATHAN set default_role = 'SYSADMIN';
alter user PLOGANATHAN set default_warehouse = 'COMPUTE_WH';
alter user PLOGANATHAN set default_namespace = 'UTIL_DB.PUBLIC';

//üî† Your Account Locator 
select current_account(); --LWB18040
