//üìì Extracting, Transforming and Loading
//üìì Defining the Transformed State
/*
Data Engineers often perform a series of ETL steps and so they have different "layers" where data is expected to have reached certain levels of refinement or transformation. In this workshop we'll have named our layers: 
RAW
ENHANCED
CURATED
In this next step, Kishore will try to make the RAW data more valuable than it is currently, by adding information that will ENHANCE that data. 
*/
//üìì A Project Status Meeting
//üìì Next Steps
/*
The team discusses alternative ways to get time zone information for each gamer.  Kishore notes that IP Addresses can be geo-located and that geolocation can be used to infer a time zone. 
Agnie mentions that the use of VPNs can mess up IP Geolocation. That's a problem, but the team agrees that using the IP address, even with the VPN issue, is better than not having any time zone information at all. 
Tsai asks Kishore how he plans to perform the IP Geolocation process.  Kishore says there are lots of options. He notes that there are lookup API services available.
Then, Tsai asks if anyone has checked the Marketplace to see if any companies are offering IP Address-based time zone look up via a share. Kishore quickly searches the Marketplace and finds a listing from a company called IPInfo. The sample data is free and the team can look up at least some of their gamers' locations. When they're sure it will work, they can talk to IPInfo about premium data. 

Kishore's first data TRANSFORMATION will be to ENHANCE the log data by adding time zone to each row. 
*/
//üéØ Use Snowflake's PARSE_IP Function

/*üéØ Pull Out PARSE_IP Results Fields
We can pull out the values from the PARSE_IP results by adding a colon and the name after the close parentheses, like this: 
select parse_ip('107.217.231.17','inet'):host;
Or this:
select parse_ip('107.217.231.17','inet'):family;
Use the IP Address that was assigned to Kishore's headset and pull out the ipv4 property. This value is just Kishore's IP Address formatted a different way. We need his IP Address in the ipv4 format because it is easier to compare to other numbers.

We are especially interested in using two of the functions IPInfo has provided to us.
The TO_JOIN_KEY function reduces the IP Down to an integer that is helpful for joining with a range of rows that might match our IP Address.
The TO_INT function converts IP Addresses to integers so we don't have to try to compare them as strings!

/*
We have a timestamp in every row of our logs that tells us the date and time the gaming event (login or logoff) took place. 
Based on his calculations and tracking, Kishore feels confident those timestamps are in UTC+0. 
Now we have the local time zone for many of our gamers. 
These 3 pieces of information are exactly what we need to create a new column that contains the local date and time of the gaming event. 
Kishore will use a function he found on docs.snowflake.com called CONVERT_TIMEZONE. 
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/convert_timezone#examples

//üìì Planning More Data Enhancements
/*
Agnie and Tsai are impressed and want to know what other enhancements Kishore is planning to make. Kishore explains that he wants to hear their ideas about what would be useful. 
Agnie is wanting to know what time of the day gamers are playing. Is it after school? In the evenings? Late at night? 
Tsai suggests knowing which days of the week, like weekdays versus weekends would also be helpful. 
Kishore thinks he can also figure out how long they are playing the game each time they log in and out, and asks if that seems interesting. 
Everyone agrees that these three data enhancements sound great and Kishore says he'll let them know when he's got them added.

//üéØ Add A Column Called DOW_NAME

üìì Assigning a Time of Day
Agnie wants to know what "time" of day people are playing her game. But when asking Kishore for "the time," she's not requesting a number, she wants something more like "Before Breakfast" or "After School." 
Kishore doesn't think that makes any sense because "Before Breakfast" is not reliable across cultures and age groups. Tsai, in her role as BSA, tries to facilitate the discussion to help Agnie and Kishore find a compromise. 
After some back and forth, Kishore and Agnie agree that using labels like "Early morning" and "Mid-morning," for example, are an acceptable compromise for both of them. 
Kishore asks Agnie to write out what she wants to call each portion of the day and send it to the team via email.

üìì Query Complexity
Our select statement is starting to get somewhat complex. It might be a good idea to take the results and move them somewhere, especially now that the data is no longer RAW, it's starting to merit being referred to as ENHANCED. 
We could wrap our select in a view, but the select is already based on a view, joined with a share and another table. It might be nice to write the data into a table to sort of lock it down.
To create the table we can use a CTAS -- a Create Table as Select. CTAS statements are a really quick way to create a table. It's not a long-term solution, but a stepping stone as we work out the process logic.
