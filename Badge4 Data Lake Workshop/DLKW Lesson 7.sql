WKT Playground was nice enough to take our string (that looked like a GeoSpatial object) and convert it to a GeoSpatial Object and display it. 
But Snowflake will expect you to convert it yourself. That's easy! We can use the TO_GEOGRAPHY( ) function!

ðŸŽ¯ TO_GEOGRAPHY Challenge Lab!!
Can You Add the TO_GEOGRAPHY() Function to the query above so the length_of_trail column will work properly and no longer throw an error?

HINT: Before we can calculate the length of a LINESTRING, the data has to be a LINESTRING, not just a list of coordinates that looks like a LINESTRING (but is really just a plain, old STRING).

ðŸŽ¯ Change your DENVER_AREA_TRAILS view to include a Length Column!
You can add a column to the view by replacing the whole view with changes.

To get a copy of a CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW code block for your existing view, run this bit of code: 

select get_ddl('view', 'DENVER_AREA_TRAILS');
Run the statement above, then copy the results (the view definition) up into the worksheet code area where you can edit it.

You can also get the data definition by navigating to the home screen, navigating to the object, and copying it from there, but the GET_DDL() function is a handy trick to know.
