/*
According to some online blog posts, you don't need more than 8 decimal points on coordinates to get accuracy to within a millimeter. Remember that Latitudes are between 0 (the equator)  and 90 (the poles) so no more than 2 digits are needed left of the decimal for latitude data.
Longitudes are between 0 (the prime meridian) and 180. So no more than 3 digits are needed to the left of the decimal for longitude data.
If we cast both longitude and latitude data as NUMBER(11,8) we should be safe.  We have included the code for this select statement below.
