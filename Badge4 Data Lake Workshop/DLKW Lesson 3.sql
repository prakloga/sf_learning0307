ðŸ““ Simple Selects on Non-Loaded Data
We've done this before in other workshops. Remember that we can query data in a file, before we even load it. Let's explore the 3 flat files in the ZMD stage. 
We're going to use a select statement on files in the @UNI_KLAUS_ZMD Stage, which we'll refer to as "the ZMD" for short. We can't run a select star - it won't work for data that hasn't been loaded.
Since we know very little about the structure of the files, let's just see what appears in the first column ($1) of each file.

//ðŸ¥‹ Query Data in Just One File at a Time 
--Can you modify the select statement so it only queries one file at a time? Pick a file name from the LIST command, and try to change your SELECT statement so it only queries the data from one of the 3 files.
--Try it, and then go to the next page to see how we wrote our query.

//ðŸ““ What is Going On Here?
/*
The data looks really weird, right? 

Snowflake hasn't been told anything about how the data in these files is structured so it's just making assumptions.  Snowflake is presuming that the files are CSVs because CSVs are a very popular file-formatting choice. It's also presuming each row ends with CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) because CRLF is also very common as a row delimiter.

Snowflake hedges its bets and presumes if you don't tell it anything about your file, the file is probably a standard CSV.

By using these assumptions, Snowflake treats the product_coordination_suggestions.txt file as if it only has one column and one row. 


ðŸ““ How Can We Tell Snowflake More about the Structure of Our File?
Of course you know the answer because we've been using File Formats since Badge 1.

We need to create some File Formats to help guide Snowflake in handling these files.

//ðŸ¥‹ Dealing with Unexpected Characters
/*
Many data files use CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) as the record delimiter, so if a different record delimiter is used, the CRLF can end up displayed or loaded! When strange characters appear in your data, you can refine your select statement to deal with them. 

In SQL we can use ASCII references to deal with these characters. 

13 is the ASCII for Carriage return
10 is the ASCII for Line Feed
SQL has a function, CHR() that will allow you to reference ASCII characters by their numbers.  So, chr(13) is the same as the Carriage Return character and chr(10) is the same as the Line Feed character. 

In Snowflake, we can CONCATENATE two values by putting || between them (a double pipe). So we can look for CRLF by telling Snowflake to look for:

 chr(13)||chr(10)
