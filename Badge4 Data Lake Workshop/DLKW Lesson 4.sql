//Lesson 4: Working with External Unstructured Data | ðŸ““ External Data is Easy!

//ðŸ““ External Data is Easy, Let's Do Some More!
/*
Remember that Zena (and you) started by creating three External Stage objects to point at 3 cloud folders in an AWS S3 bucket that is owned and managed by Zena's friend, Klaus.

Zena then focused her efforts on one of those stages - the ZMD stage - that happens to contain only STRUCTURED data files. She learned to use FILE FORMATS and VIEWS to make the files very accessible without even loading her data into a Snowflake table!  

Zena has two other External Stage objects she set up. Next, she wants to use her UNI_KLAUS_CLOTHING stage, however, that stage points at a cloud folder that contains images.

Images are considered UNSTRUCTURED data, so she's wondering if accessing images without loading them will be just as easy as the flat files. 

Zena's not sure but she'll give it a try!


ðŸŽ¯ Run a List Command On the Clothing Stage
Remember that Zena began exploring non-loaded data by running a LIST command on the ZMD stage. Run a LIST command on the CLOTHING Stage you created. What do you see?

/*For images, we'll have to keep looking and find a better way.We'll search the online Docs for "Unstructured Data" and notice something called a "Directory Table." 
Directory Tables might work! So let's explore them further! A few important tips about Directory Tables. 

They are attached to a Stage (internal or external).  
You have to enable them. 
You have to refresh them.
